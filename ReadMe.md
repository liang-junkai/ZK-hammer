# ZK-hammer

This project demonstrates how to leak secrets from zk-SNARK, which was implemented by _libsnark_ via Rowhammer. The project contains the analysis to recover the secret for GGPR13, PGHR13 and Groth16. For each algorithm, we provide the PDF file for analyse of the algorithm and necessary source code related to Rowhammer. The CVE number related to this project is _TBD_.
